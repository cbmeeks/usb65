usb65 - USB host and device drivers for the 6502
------------------------------------------------

This repository holds host and device drivers for 6502 processors. The aim is to make
them generic enough so they can be reused in many 6502 computers.

Currently supported functionalities:

- Keyboard (host+device)
- mouse (host+device)
- hub (as host, can enumerate devices connected via a hub!)

Currently supported hardware:

- SL811HS (host+device) via processor bus interface
- MAX3420 (device) via an SPI interface
- MAX3421 (host+device - device is same as MAX3420) via an SPI interface

Currently supported platforms:

- CS/A "Fat40" PET replica with
	- NETUSB 1.x board (2 SL811HS for host and device)
	- NETUSB 2.x board (MAX3420 for device + MAX3421 for host)

- Commodore PET with CS/A adapter 
	- (tested only with NETUSB 1.x)

Future plans:
-------------

- code cleanup
	- more generic assembler
	- extract common code
	- separate platform specific code
- more supported platforms
- more functionalities
	- RS232 via USB
	- mass storage device (USB stick)
	- Network (ethernet?) via USB

Content
-------

- host/
	USB host driver code
- device/
	UBS device driver code
- common/
	separated out common code (e.g. for messages, or USB headers)
- drivers/
	hardware drivers for USB and necessary others (like SPI)
- hardware/
	description of supported hardware

Note: that currently that's all there is, as those have been separately developed.
There will be new subdirectories for:

- platform/
	hold the platform specific code

Build note
----------

At this time you need the "xa65" cross assembler to build it (and its associated
"reloc65" tool). And even more, you need the head of the "listing" branch on github:
https://github.com/fachat/xa65/tree/listing

You can then "make" the code in the host/ and device/ subdirectories

It builds test executables for the CS/A for now. Those have a Commodore PET header,
i.e. can be LOADed and RUN to a) enumerate the USB bus or b) let the PET be a keyboard
for a PC.


Known bugs
----------

- hub enumeration on MAX3421 does not yet work. 
- keyboard mapping is preliminary
- Only few features are implemented. E.g. there is no power management
